# An Analysis of the Determinants of Offering Prices for Residential Real Estate in Curitiba through Hedonic Regression

The present study aimed to thoroughly investigate the dynamics of residential property 
prices in the city of Curitiba, employing the hedonic analysis methodology. This analytical 
method allowed the decomposition of a goodâ€™s price based on its specific characteristics, 
providing a detailed understanding of how each particular attribute influences the final value of 
the property. The research utilized a robust econometric approach, based on Ordinary Least 
Squares (OLS) regression models in logarithmic form. Data collection was conducted using 
web scraping techniques, extracting information from real estate portals such as QuintoAndar, 
Imovelweb, and VivaReal. Additionally, the data was complemented with geospatial and 
socioeconomic information available from public access portals of the Institute of Urban 
Research and Planning of Curitiba (IPPUC), ensuring the comprehensiveness and accuracy 
of the analyzed data. The proposed methodology also incorporated rigorous validation tests to 
ensure the adequacy of the econometric models used, guaranteeing that the obtained results 
were reliable and statistically significant. The results obtained by the present study suggest 
that the city of Curitiba is a monocentric urban center with distinct social stratifications. 
Consequently, these findings allow state authorities to better understand the dynamics of the 
city's real estate market, facilitating, among other actions, the development of public policies.

Overall, the codes pertaining to this study were divided into five parts: 
* 1. Web scraping and data wrangling; 
* 2. Principal component analysis; 
* 3. Geoprocessing;
* 4. Regression I (Rosen's First Stage);
* 5. Regression II (Rosen's Second Stage).

All in all, this code aims to support anyone interested in performing some hedonic regression analysis.

ps: this code was developed for a project under the MBA in Data Science by ESALQ-USP.
